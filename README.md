Welcome to my <strong>Code Archive Repository</strong>! This repository serves as a centralized collection of important scripts, programs, and code snippets that I&rsquo;ve developed or curated. The purpose is to archive valuable code for future reference, reuse, or sharing with others. The repository includes a variety of projects, utilities, and experiments across different programming languages and domains. The repository is accessible <a href="https://github.com/shadnanm/Coding" target="_blank">here</a>.
